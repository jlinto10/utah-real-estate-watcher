# Utah Real Estate Watcher

The purpose of this tool is to monitor changes on real estate listings found at www.utahrealestate.com. Currently the housing market in Utah is on fire, many home don't stay on the market more than a day. My hope for this tool is to give home buyers an edge in quickly discovering changes in listings.

Currently, it's only capable of reading the listings. The future will include ways to discover changes to listings.
